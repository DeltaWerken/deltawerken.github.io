Remove the bottom part of the printer by detaching the power cable going to the top electronics bay, continue by removing the 4 M5x12mm screws from the columns. The base of the printer should be free now. Continue with removing the bottom lid button head screws until you have access to the bottom bay: . The drill jig fits nicely against the spacers inside the frame. Do mind that you may have to remove the vertical post that the mains wiring is attached to, using pliers is probably sufficient as the weld isn’t super strong. If you are afraid of damaging the case, use a rotary cut tool or a hacksaw. Before you start drilling make sure to remove the power supply from the case and disconnect all the wiring. Transfer the holes with the jig using a center punch, then continue drilling the four holes for each of the motor positions. Once the holes are drilled, you can screw down the motor using the M3x8mm bolts. It is advised to add M3 washers between the bolts and the holes. Adding the AWD belt . Soon! ™ . ",
