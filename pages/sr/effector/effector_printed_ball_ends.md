# Printed effector with threaded ball ends

![Effector with M3 threads](/assets/images/sr/effector/effector_printed_joints_ball_ends.png)

Using the [effector_ball_joints.stl](https://github.com/DeltaWerken/SuperRacer/raw/main/stl/effector/effector_ball_joints.stl?download=) printed effector plate, you can use any type of M3 threaded ball ends. For repurposing the stock arms, it is recommended to use 8mm stainless steel balls with an M3 thread and 10mm M3 set screws to connect them to the effector plate.
