# Frequently Asked Questions

## Where can we reach the project members?

You can find us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/jz2dTMYj5d).

## Why the SuperRacer, why not XYZ?

Because they are relatively affordable, readily available and available for purchase as a used item [from FLSUN directly](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DCdslDF).

## Why not a custom frame?

There will be a custom frame eventually, just not for the initial public beta.

The current state of the project is **work in progress**. The detailed pages of each component mentions a *component state* as follows:
* **alpha**: the component is in testing by the development team
* **beta**: the component is in testing by the beta testers group
